# SoundCloud View Bot

This repository contains a simple Java program that automates streaming a SoundCloud track in order to increase its play count.

## How It Works
The program:
- Opens a SoundCloud link in your default browser (such as Chrome).
- Plays the track for roughly 40 seconds.
- Refreshes the page to replay the track a specified number of times.

By doing this repeatedly, it can help increase the track’s play count. However, remember that the incremental plays it provides are minimal and will only represent a tiny fraction of your total plays.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your system (if you want to compile and run via command line).
- **Robot and Desktop classes** are used, so ensure your system supports these (most standard Java-capable systems do).

If you prefer a simple setup, use **BlueJ**, a beginner-friendly Java IDE.

## Running with BlueJ

Visit [bluej.org](https://bluej.org/) and download **BlueJ**. It’s free and simple to install. BlueJ allows you to view and run the Java code I’ve provided.

**Once installed:**
1. Open BlueJ.
2. Click **Project** in the top-left menu.
3. Select **New Project** and give it any name you like.
4. Click the **New Class** button on the left side.
5. Name the new class (you can pick any name; it will update later on).
6. Double-click the newly created class icon (the brownish box). In the editor window that opens, **delete all existing text** and then **paste in all the code (SoundCloudViewBot.java) file** I provided.
7. Click the **Compile** button and then close the editor window.
8. Right-click the brown box (it should be labeled **“SoundCloudViewBot”**).
9. Choose the **void main(String[] args)** option from the menu that appears. (Be sure to follow these steps exactly as described. Don’t make assumptions.)
10. Click **OK** when prompted.
11. When asked, enter the **link to the song** you want to stream.
12. Enter the **number of times** you want to play it. (Keep the number in the low thousands or less at a time.)

A Chrome window should open with your song. Click full screen if desired. The song will play for about 40 seconds, then refresh and repeat. It might not loop immediately, so give it a few seconds. This process provides a steady flow of streams for your track, which can help it appear on recommended lists. Other requirements for getting on recommended lists will run in the background; you don’t need to do anything more.

**Note:** The plays generated by this program are a small percentage of your total plays.

## Tips
- Mute your computer volume so the sound isn’t disruptive.
- Run the program at times you don’t need your computer, like overnight.
- I would recommend to run a few plays at a time and not going all out at once (Ex. Don't do 500 plays at once)

## Stopping the Program
To stop the program before it finishes playing all the streams:
- Open the window with the brown box and click the arrow in the bottom-right corner, or simply **close BlueJ**.
